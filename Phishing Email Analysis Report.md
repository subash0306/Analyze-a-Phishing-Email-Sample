# Phishing Email Analysis Report

---

1. Objective
The goal of this task is to analyze a suspicious email and identify phishing indicators by examining the sender, email headers, message body, and embedded links. This helps build awareness of phishing tactics and email-based social engineering threats.

3. SpamAssassin and Header Findings

| Category | Finding | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| SPF | None | Domain not authorized to send mail from this IP |
| DKIM | None | Message not cryptographically signed |
| DMARC | Permerror | No policy / invalid configuration |
| SPF Sender Domain | thcultarfdes.co.uk | Not related to Microsoft |
| Return Path | bounce@thcultarfdes.co.uk | Different from From/Reply-To |
| Reply-To | sotrecognizd@gmail.com | Public freemail, unrelated to sender |
| Spam Score (SCL) | 5 | High spam probability |
| Sender IP | 89.144.44.2 | Suspicious external host |
| AuthResult | spf=none, dkim=none, dmarc=permerror | All authentication checks failed |

4. Email Body Examination

# Key Message:
> **“Unusual sign.in activity”**  
> We detected something unusual about a recent sign-in to your Microsoft account.  
> A user from **Russia/Moscow** just logged into your account.  
> If this wasn’t you, please report the user.  
> [**Report The User**] → (mailto link to `sotrecognizd@gmail.com`)

# Suspicious Elements:
> Urgent alert language creating fear of account compromise.
> “Report The User” button links to `mailto:sotrecognizd@gmail.com` (not Microsoft).
> Hidden tracking pixel from `http://thebandalisty.com/track/...`.
> Fake Microsoft formatting, incorrect “sign.in” usage, and unprofessional markup.
> Random code inside `<style>` tags—likely obfuscation.

5. Phishing Indicators

| # | Indicator | Description | Evidence |
|---|------------|--------------|-----------|
| 1 | Spoofed sender | From/Reply-To/Return-Path all differ | access-accsecurity.com / thcultarfdes.co.uk / gmail.com |
| 2 | Authentication failure | SPF/DKIM/DMARC missing | spf=none, dkim=none, dmarc=permerror |
| 3 | Suspicious IP | Not owned by Microsoft | 89.144.44.2 |
| 4 | Freemail Reply-To | Gmail used for reply | sotrecognizd@gmail.com |
| 5 | Tracking pixel | Hidden image beacon | thebandalisty.com/track/... |
| 6 | Urgent message | Fear-based alert | Body text |
| 7 | Grammar errors | “sign.in”, malformed text | Body text |
| 8 | Non-Microsoft URLs | No official domain links | mailto Gmail link |
| 9 | HTML-only email | No plain text version | SpamAssassin body tag |

6. Analysis Summary
   
Indicators of Phishing:  
> Spoofed sender identity and domain mismatch.  
> Authentication failures (SPF/DKIM/DMARC).  
> Freemail reply-to and hidden tracking pixel.  
> Urgency-based message design.  
> Grammar and structure errors.  

Conclusion:
This is a *phishing email* impersonating Microsoft to trick users into replying or sharing credentials. It uses social engineering and spoofed headers.

---

7. Recommended Mitigation Steps
> Do *not click* or reply to links in the email.
> *Report* as phishing to Microsoft or your email provider.
>  *Block* sender domains (`access-accsecurity.com`, `thcultarfdes.co.uk`, `thebandalisty.com`).
>  Enable *Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)* on accounts.
>  Run *antivirus scans* if any link was clicked.
>  *Educate users* on verifying links before action.
